I have created a simple way to track bicycle rides, 
  register for group bicylce rides, 
  and host a group bicycle ride for a cycling group. 
This stems from my frustration with the current cycling group that I am in. 
  They list bike rides on their website which is not mobile optimized
    Is awkward to navigate even on a web browser
    Contains no tracking information on riders attending
    And is often out of date or not updated.
Eventually I want to build this app out so that the ride host can log in and update:
  Riders that attended
  Total Miles ridden that will update a SQL database to track riders mileage throughout the year
  Track other stats like total # of rides hosted, etc.
